title: Introduction

The purpose of this blog is to provide news about openSUSE release tool improvements and process changes. The goal is to increase the transparency and visibility of what is going on behind the scenes to improve the openSUSE release process and therefore the experience of contributors and users. Most of the content here will be fairly technical regarding the details of the changes being made with some announcements covering highlights for a broader audience.

For the first year or so posts will include highlights from last year in order to catch-up up a bit.
