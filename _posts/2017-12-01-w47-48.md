# Tumbleweed snapshots

The [announcement]({% post_url 2017-11-22-Tumbleweed-Snapshots %}) was [picked up by Phoronix](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Snaps) and [discussed on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/7fwyvv/opensusefactory_announcing_tumbleweed_snapshots/) among other places. It seems readers are either unsure of the purpose or very happy with the announcement. As such I plan to create a verbose video explanation to aid in understanding and marketing the concept.

The initial usage numbers are promising although without the unique identifier provided to `download.opensuse.org` by `zypper` it is impossible to get a clear number of users.

The bandwidth usage is relatively low, as expected, since users are generally updating to the latest snapshot and thus being redirected to the normal mirroring network.

# repo-checker

One of the long-existing caches used by `repo-checker` for cycles information was observed, by lnussel, to be in excess of `20GB`. The size of the cache was slowing things down rather than speeding them up. The [cache was restricted to just target projects (ex. Leap 15.0 or Factory)](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1280) and no longer includes staging projects. This resolved the issue while still caching the relevant bits and dropped 5-10 minutes off the cycle check.

# last year

At this time last year I created the initial prototype for snapshotting the main product repositories and individual OBS project repositories. The [Tumbleweed snapshots prototype was announced on the `opensuse-factory` mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-12/msg00025.html) and received several dozen users.
