title: "2017w49-50: obs-service-tar_scm version rewrite regular expression"
---

Spent time working on setting up this blog and writing initial posts, issue triage, and package list wrapper rewrite. Otherwise, no outcomes of interest.

# last year

[Added version rewrite using a regex pattern and replacement](https://github.com/M0ses/obs-service-tar_scm/pull/1) to [`obs-service-tar_scm`](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm). Rather than workaround version with a leading `v` like `v1.0.0`, as is common, the version is rewritten during execution of the `_service` file to `1.0.0`. An example can be found in the [`adminer`](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/server:php:applications/adminer) package that I maintain.

```xml
<services>
  <service name="tar_scm" mode="disabled">
    <param name="versionformat">@PARENT_TAG@</param>
    <param name="versionrewrite-pattern">v(.*)</param>
    <param name="revision">refs/tags/v4.4.0</param>
    <param name="url">https://github.com/vrana/adminer.git</param>
    <param name="scm">git</param>
    <param name="changesgenerate">enable</param>
  </service>
  <service name="recompress" mode="disabled">
    <param name="compression">xz</param>
    <param name="file">*.tar</param>
  </service>
  <service name="set_version" mode="disabled"/>
</services>
```

The relevant bit being:

```xml
<param name="versionrewrite-pattern">v(.*)</param>
```

as the default for `versionrewrite-replacement` is `\1`. This approach ends up with a cleanly named:

```
adminer-1.0.0.tar.xz
```

that is consistent with the spec `Version` of `1.0.0` instead of

```
adminer-v1.0.0.tar.xz
```

A goal was to eventually expand this to support `revision` patterns like `1.*.*`, or similar, so the service can be run in such a way as to update the version, but is still reproducible rather than pointing at `head`. The same concept behind the _lock_ file in many language specific package managers.
