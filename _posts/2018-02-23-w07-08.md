# package lists generator drop list considers update repos

Following up on the [addition of a drop list generator]({% post_url 2018-02-09-w05-06 %}) the code now [considers _update_ repositories](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1406). The released repositories, _oss_ and _non-oss_, are merged with their update counterparts. This provides a more accurate drop list that should provide for a cleaner post-upgrade system. For an idea of the impact take a look at the [diff on OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/openSUSE:Leap:15.0/000product?full_diff=true&linkrev=base&rev=141) after the change was deployed.

There is an [ongoing discussion regarding where to store the solv files](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1407) since they cannot be re-created for releases that are out of support and removed from _download.opensuse.org_.

# Leap 15.0 repo-checker no longer reviews i586

The [`repo-checker` was changed to only review the `x86_64` repo](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1405), which includes imported `i586` pacakges, rather than reviewing both repos in their entirety. Unlike _Tumbleweed_, _Leap_ does not target `i586` as an installable arch, but rather just for providing `-32bit` packages. Devel packages receiving `repo-checker` comments regarding `i586` dependency chains should desist.

# metrics.o.o weekly data ingest enabled

In lieu of [OBS providing control over request order via API](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/4108) the data ingest process has been [configured to run weekly](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/adb01e2c58c93fdd20e4d7ba12f0ac518a35a8d9/systemd/osrt-metrics%40.timer#L8), instead of daily. The service timer has been enabled and should ingest data regularly.

# Tumbleweed snapshot review site

Extensive work was completed towards providing a site for reviewing Tumbleweed snapshot stability by aggregating data from a variety of sources. The goal is to provide insight into the stability trends of Tumbleweed and aid in avoiding troublesome snapshots when desired. More details to be forthcoming.

# last year

`factory-auto` bot was corrected to [properly warn when issue references were removed](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/679) as the diff was backwards and to allow for [self-submission](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/682) for the purpose of reverting a package to a prior version of self.

The `osc-staging` plugin was enhanced to [provide link in staging comment to project dashboard](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/683) to aid in discovery and some ever important [documentation corrections](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/686).

The `ReviewBot` base was significantly refactored to avoid duplication and over complexity in subsequent bots.

- [#684](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/684): ReviewBot: refactor leaper comment from log functionality.
- [#685](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/685): ReviewBot: use `super().check_source_submission()` in subclasses.
- [#692](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/692): ReviewBot: extract `__class__.__name__` as default for `self.bot_name`.
- [#693](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/693): ReviewBot & leaper: provide deduplicate method for leaper comment (and other fixes)

In another attempt to aid in feature discovery the `leaper` bot was changed to [let request submitters know when the request would have been automatically generated](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/694). On a similar note the staging `unselect` command was tweaked to [print a message suggesting use of new ignore psuedo-sate](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/695).

Significant work was done towards providing completely automated staging strategies via the addition of `--non-interactive`, `--merge`, `--try-strategies`, and `--strategies` options. The prototype was run against _Leap 42.3_ and scrutinized to hone the strategies. A related tool was prototyped for triggering flaky package rebuilds in staging projects.

For [SUSE Hackweek 15](https://hackweek.suse.com/15) I [worked on what eventually turned into `metrics.opensuse.org`](https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/track-statistics-on-the-opensuse-staging-process-to-gain-feedback-on-changes). The focus was on selecting the appropriate tools and determining what to use as the data source. After the OBS team denied request to get read access of data dumps of request related tables I settled on ingesting the data (over `800MB` of XML) via the API.
