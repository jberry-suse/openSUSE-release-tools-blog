title: "Announcing metrics.opensuse.org"
---

[metrics.opensuse.org](https://metrics.opensuse.org/) has been available for a
few weeks, but now has an accompanying video presentation to help make sense of
the information. The goal of the effort was to provide insight into the staging
process used to build both openSUSE and SLE releases and the impact of tooling
changes on the process. The implementation is comprised of three parts:

- [python script](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/4661a09b2f27676c1944bd47e7d19bb99f09058f/metrics.py) for ingesting and processing request histories
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to which data is written
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for presenting data

The end result can be seen below.

For those familiar with the staging process the graphs will likely make some
sense, but for those without a firm understanding of the process a bit of
explanation is required. A video explanation of the various graphs and details
behind the data can be seen below.
