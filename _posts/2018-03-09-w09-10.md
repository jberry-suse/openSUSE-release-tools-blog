# ReviewBot overrides via comment commands

Something which has been discussed for quite a while, [a method for overriding bot reviews](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1427), was added recently. The functionality ended up being to interpret comments in the form `@bot <command> [args...]`. Comment commands are then restricted to members of either a configured group or the staging group. For example release overrides addressed to `leaper` may be issued by anyone in `leap-reviewers` group or `factory-staging` (responsible for staging process).

`repo-checker` gained the ability to skip the cycles check via a comment command placed on a staging project (`@repo-checker skip-cycle`). Previously, this had to be done via the command line by manually running the bot.

The final decision towards this workflow was clear after it [turned out OBS groups were insufficient](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1400#issuecomment-365408620) for the override workflow.

[`leaper` was also modified](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1431) to leave previously _declined_ reviews open for SLE manager override. A [similar change](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1455) will be made to the _openSUSE_ portion of the bot.

# Quality of life changes

Instead of printing the list of packages, requiring the package to be _deleted_, to build as a flat list it is [formatted as a bulleted list](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1430) by `repo-checker`.

```
sad-package is still a build requirement of package1, package2, package3
```

to

```
sad-package is still a build requirement of:

- package1
- package2
- package3
```

Similarly, `ReviewBot`s were changed to [_accept_ unhandled request types without posting a comment](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1426) to reduce e-mail spam.

[All config options are now lazy-loaded](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1432) to allow for placement in remote config.

# metrics.o.o update for Grafana 5.x and TW review site

In light of the _Grafana_ 5.x series changing the dashboard format the existing [4.x dashboards were migrated](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1451). [The Tumbleweed snapshot review site]({% post_url 2018-02-26-Tumbleweed-snapshot-review-site %}) data can now also be [ingested and presented](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1444). Both improvements are scheduled for deployment to [metrics.opensuse.org](https://metrics.opensuse.org/) next week.

# pkglistgen adventures

A rather interesting bug was causing the [`pkglistgen.py`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/3bd6833f89583dea77285a1d2da8c39071e6aa24/pkglistgen.py) code to crash on _Leap 15.0_ after `Build153.1` during drop list creation. It ended up being solved by [adding a `flush()` call before passing the file to read by `libsolv`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1439). The situation would have been easier to resolve if the `libsolv` components complained about in incomplete _XML_ file, but instead the invalid data makes it through a chain of tools before being read by a tool that complains. In addition to fixing the problem the metadata hash is now validated as further assurance that the correct data is present.

The [repo metadata hash for update repos](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1442) is now used to avoid downloading unchanged information.

To complete the week for `pkglistgen` the addition of services to _Leap 15.0_ exposed the need to [skip local service run during update](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1445).

# repo-checker for SLE 15

Lastly, the `repo-checker` is now utilized for SLE 15.0 development which should reduce both the pre-release problems in _SLE 15_, but also in _Leap 15.0_ since it sources core packages from _SLE_. In combination with _Factory_ this should elevate the quality of pre-releases and even the final releases in addition to reducing negative staging results.

# last year

One of the biggest acheivements of last year was the introduction of [select automation: merge and strategies](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/702) which ended up taking over the majority of staging grouping work. An example of using the strategies in _interactive_ mode can be seen in [2018w01-02]({% post_url 2018-01-12-w01-02 %}#requestsplitter). The work was based on observations and involvement with _Leap 42.3_ and _Factory_ staging. Five strategies were created which are evaluated against the open requests based on a priority order. The result is rather powerful automated staging and follow-up staging.

Stagings which were initially filled using a strategy can have further requests `--merge`d into them that match the same strategy. This combined with configurable time period since first staging and other conditions makes for a solid follow-up workflow allowing maintainers to send requests organically. An initial waiting period of an hour is used to allow for patterns to emerge.

A `staging-bot` user was created under which this code and more now runs as a service. One can clearly see it take over for _Factory_ in the `Staged - User*` graphs on [metrics.opensuse.org](https://metrics.opensuse.org/).

[![staging-bot take-over of Factory]({{ "image/staging-bot-take-over-factory.png" | absolute_url }})]({{ "image/staging-bot-take-over-factory.png" | absolute_url }})

The strategies were also integrated into the [OBS dashboard](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs_factory) which allows one to quickly tell what strategy was used for each staging. Note the white section within the _Project_ column on the left in the below images (ex. special, kernel-source).

The existing feature set was [documented in repo wiki](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/wiki/Automate-staging-workflow) for staging masters and future plans were organized in a [github project](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/projects/1).

Towards the same goal of automating staging work several commands were [given `--cleanup` flags](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/704) to remove mundane and neglected tasks. Similarly, [a `rebuild` command](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/714) was introduced to [trigger rebuilds of flaky packages](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/725) rather than waiting hours for a staging master to come around.

A couple quality of life improvements were made:

- [`frozenage` defaults to all letter stagings](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/717) (to avoid typing all of them)
- [include a `--message` option in `unselect`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/720) to allow for ignoring a request while un-staging since both are commonly done together
- [provide an `unlock` command](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/711) to resolve stuck staging locks

All in the same week, a [tool for interacting with devel projects](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/718) was introduced. The tool provides an overview of the requests to devel projects and the open reviews for devel project (requests targeting _Factory_). The `--remind` feature is run as a service to create review reminder comments of which contributors are likely familiar.

On the OBS end, changes were made to the `obs_factory` plugin in order to [improve development experience](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs_factory/pull/68), [harden validation](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs_factory/pull/70), and [enhance the API](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs_factory/pull/69) for use by the staging tools. Rather than make hundreds of individual API calls a single aggregate call could be made which drastically improved performance.
