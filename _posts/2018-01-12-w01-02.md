# package list wrapper scripts port and rewrite

After the [rewrite](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1312) was merged (before full testing) a series of small follow-ups ([#1328](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1328), [#1332](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1332), [#1333](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1333)) were required to bring everything into working order. After that the code has been happily deployed for [Leap 15.0](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Leap:15.0).

A [few items remain](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1329) in order to bring the SLE wrappers into the fold.

# flesh out comment tests

As part of the long-term goal of increasing test coverage a [detailed set was added](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1318) to cover the code responsible for interacting with [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/) comments. Additionally, the [`ReviewBot` specific comment code was also covered](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1319). The tests are a combination of unit and functional tests that utilize the [local OBS instance brough up on travis-ci](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/dist/ci/docker-compose-obs) for a net gain of around _1.5%_ coverage.

# adi packages with baselibs.conf staged for all archs

Packages not contained within the [ring projects](https://build.opensuse.org/project/subprojects/openSUSE:Factory:Rings) are placed in [`adi` stagings](https://build.opensuse.org/project/subprojects/openSUSE:Factory:Staging) which are only built for `x86_64`. For packages utilizing a [`baselibs.conf`](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/wine/baselibs.conf?expand=1) such as [`wine`](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/wine) this is less than ideal since the imported packages are not built. For `wine` specifically this causes the package to never pass the `repo-checker` since the `wine (x86_64)` package requires the `wine-32bit` package which is not built.

To solve the `wine` case and allow `baselibs.conf` to be tested in stagings the `adi` process was [enhanced to detect `baselibs.conf` and enable all archs from the target project](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1320) (for `Factory` this includes `i586`). This handles both static `baselibs.conf` and those that are generated during by the `spec` file.

# config generalization

As part of an ongoing process to standardize the execution and configuration of the various tools to reduce the management overhead, various flags have been migrated to be read out of [project configuration](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/osclib/conf.py#L34-L138). This allows tools to be run without flags via standardized service files while the config defaults can be managed centrally and overridden in [OBS remote config](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory:Staging/dashboard/config?expand=1).

The [config system was expanded to support non-distribution projects](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1321) to allow for tools to be run against devel projects like `GNOME:Factory` which has long utilized `factory-auto`. This exposes the flags that were previously available via the project config. Interestingly, the change had to be reverted and [re-introduced with pattern ordering](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1327). Had been luck that the issue had not been a problem prior to this point.

# NonFree workflow

A [discussion of the `NonFree` workflow](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1247) was started regarding including such requests in the normal staging workflow. As a consequence of not being staged the new `repo_checker` can not process the requests.

# obs_clone improvements

The [`obs_clone`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/obs_clone.py) tool clones data between OBS instances which is used to load a facsimile of `Factory` into a local OBS instance for testing. Without a large amount of specific project setup the various tools cannot function and thus cannot be tested. After a hiccup in `Factory` the project had to be rebuilt by bootstrapping against a staging project. This caused a [circular dependency which the tool cannot currently handle](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/issues/1335). A [workaround was added](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1338) to resolve the issue.

As part of the debugging process a [variety of improvements were made](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1345) furthering the goal of being able to run all the tools against the local instance.

# staging-bot improvements

The [`quick` staging strategy](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/osclib/request_splitter.py#L466-L499) was [improved to handle the new `Leap 15.0` workflow and future proof the implementation](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1343). In order to process requests as quickly as possible the requests that do not require human review (ex. coming from SLE were they were already reviewed) are grouped together to avoid being blocked by other requests. The strategy has already been seen functioning correctly in production.

Towards the same goal, the [`special` strategy](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/osclib/request_splitter.py#L501-L513), which is used to isolate important packages and/or those that routinely cause problems, was [modified to be disablable](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/1344). This is utilize for `Leap` which generally sees requests from other sources which have already passed various processes and are less likely to cause issues. Thus rather than isolate such packages and thus take up an entire staging they are simply grouped normally.

# last year

Some major work was completed last year at this time.

# API request cache

In an effort to drastically improve the runtime of the various staging tools and bots an [HTTP cache was implemented](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/629) for caching specific OBS API queries and expiring them when the OBS projects were changed. The result was a significant improvement and in many cases removed over _90%_ of execution time once the caches were warmed up. Given the number of staging queries run in a day this was a major quality of life improvement.

# ignored request pseudo-state

Another quality of life improvement was the introduction of an [`ignored` request pseudo-state](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/631) for use in the staging process. This allowed staging masters to place requests in a [backlog](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory:Staging/dashboard/ignored_requests?expand=1) with a message indicating the reason. Not only did this improve the workflow for communicating such things between staging masters, but it also paved the way for automated staging improvements since this could be used to exclude requests. The pseudo-state has since become an integral part of the workflow.

Ignored requests can be seen along with their reason in the `list` output:

# RequestSplitter

A major step forward was the [creation of the `RequestSplitter`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/637) which not only replaced the different request grouping implementations, but providing a vastly more powerful solution. Not only were the previous static grouping options available, but `xpath` filters and group-bys could be specified to create complex request groupings. Prior to this such grouping had to be done manually via copy-paste from `list` sub-command or other primitive means. Given that all `ring` packages must be staged manually using this process any improvement helps.

Additionally, this made the `select` sub-command much more powerful with a variety of new options and modes including an `--interactive` mode which allowed a proposal to be modified in a text editor. The combination provides a vastly superior experience and laid the groundwork for further automation via [strategies](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/blob/a7c4bcfd32a44d371b4e70f746f585a9022b4414/osclib/request_splitter.py#L372-L513) (mentined above and to be covered in future post).

An example of interactive mode, which also includes the strategies introduced later, can be seen below.

# miscellaneous

A utility was created to [print the list of devel projects for a given project](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/628). This tool was intended to eventually replace the expensive query with the cached version which has since been done.

Yet another quality of life improvement was to [indicate if origin differs from the expected origin in the `leaper` review](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory/pull/634). This simple change aided in being able to more quickly scan through large numbers of such reviews.
